The documents are then preprocessed, and TF-IDF is used to rank the documents based on the query. BERT is employed to rank documents by semantic similarity, generating embeddings for both the query and documents. The system first retrieves documents using BERT embeddings for relevance and then refines the ranking using TF-IDF. Finally, the top-ranked documents are presented, with matching lines from the documents displayed based on the query, offering a comprehensive document retrieval system that handles both direct and conceptual queries."
