First, it extracts text from PDFs stored in a ZIP file. The documents are then preprocessed, and TF-IDF is used to rank the documents based on the query. BERT is employed to rank documents by semantic similarity, generating embeddings for both the query and documents. The system first retrieves documents using BERT embeddings for relevance and then refines the ranking using TF-IDF. Finally, the top-ranked documents are presented, with matching lines from the documents displayed based on the query, offering a comprehensive document retrieval system that handles both direct and

family\n","activities and hobbies in order to use the substance. \n","risky use of the substance is the third grouping of criteria (criteria –). this may take\n","the form of recurrent substanc e use in situations in which it is physically hazardous (cri-\n","terion ). the individual may continue substance use despite knowledge of having a per-\n","sistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or\n","exacerbated by the substance (criterion ). the key issue in evaluating this criterion is not\n","the existence of the problem, but rather the in dividual’s failure to abstain from using the\n","substance despite the difficulty it is causing. substance-related and addictive disorders\n","pharmacological criteria are the final grouping (criteria  and ). tolerance (crite-\n","rion ) is signaled by requiring a markedly in creased dose of the substance to achieve the\n","desired effect or a markedly reduced effect when the usual dose is consumed. the degree\n","to which tolerance develops varies greatly across different individuals as well as across\n","substances and may involve a va riety of central nervous system  effects. for example, tol-\n","erance to respiratory depression and tolerance to sedating and motor coordination may\n","develop at different rates, depending on the substance. tolerance ma y be difficult to de-\n","termine by history alone, and la boratory tests may be helpful (e .g., high blood levels of the\n","substance coupled with little evidence of into xication suggest that tolerance is likely). tol-\n","erance must also be distinguished from indi vidual variability in the initial sensitivity to\n","the effects of particular substances. for exam ple, some first-time alcohol drinkers show\n","very little evidence of intoxication with thre e or four drinks, whereas others of similar\n","weight and drinking histories have slurred speech and incoordination. \n","withdrawal (criterion ) is a syndrome th at occurs when blood or tissue concentra-\n","tions of a substance decline in an individual who had maintained prolonged heavy use of\n","the substance. after developi ng withdrawal symptoms, the individual is likely to con-\n","sume the substance to relieve the symptoms . withdrawal symptoms vary greatly across\n","the classes of substances, and separate criter ia sets for withdrawal are provided for the\n","drug classes. marked and generally easily me asured physiological signs of withdrawal are\n","common with alcohol, opioids, and sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics. withdrawal\n","signs and symptoms with stimulants (amphetamines and cocaine), as well as tobacco and\n","cannabis, are often present but may be le ss apparent. significant withdrawal has not been\n","documented in humans after repeated use of  phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, and in-\n","halants; therefore, this criterion is not incl uded for these substances. neither tolerance nor\n","withdrawal is necessary for a diagnosis of a substance use disorder. however, for most\n","classes of substances, a past history of withdraw al is associated with a more severe clinical\n","course (i.e., an earlier onset of a substance us e disorder, higher levels of substance intake,\n","and a greater number of substance-related problems).\n","symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal occurring during appropriate medical treat-\n","ment with prescribed medications (e.g., opio id analgesics, sedatives, stimulants) are spe-\n","cifically not counted when diagnosing a substance use disorder. the appearance of normal,\n","expected pharmacological  tolerance and withdrawal during the course of medical treat-\n","ment has been known to lead to an erroneou s diagnosis of “addiction” even when these\n","were the only symptoms pr esent. indivi duals whose only symptoms are those that occur\n","as a result of medical treatment (i.e., tolera nce and withdrawal as part of medical care\n","when the medications are taken as prescribed) sh ould not receive a diagnosis solely on the\n","basis of these symptoms. however, prescripti on medications can be used inappropriately,\n","and a substance use disorder can be correc tly diagnosed when there are other symptoms\n","of compulsive, drug-seeking behavior.\n","severity and specifiers\n","substance use disorders occur in a broad range of severity, from mild  to severe, with se-\n","verity based on the number of symptom criteria endorsed. as a general estimate of sever-\n","ity, a mild substance use disorder is suggested by the presence of two to three symptoms,\n","moderate  by four to five symptoms, and severe by six or more symptoms. changing severity\n","across time is also reflected by reductions or increases in the fr equency and/or dose of\n","substance use, as assessed by the individual’s  own report, report of knowledgeable others,\n","clinician’s observations, and biological testing. the following course specifiers and descrip-\n","tive features specifiers are a lso available for substance use di sorders: “in early remission,”\n","“in sustained remission,” “on maintenance th erapy,” and “in a cont rolled environment.”\n","definitions of each are provided within respective criteria sets. substance use disorders \n","recording procedures for substance use disorders\n","the clinician should use the code that applies to the class of substances but record the\n","name of the specific substance.  for example, the clinician should record . (f.)\n","moderate alprazolam use disorder  (rather than moderate seda tive, hypnotic, or anxiolytic\n","use disorder) or . (f.) mild methamphetamine use disorder (rather than mild\n","stimulant use disorder). for substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., anabolic\n","steroids), the appropriate code for “other su bstance use disorder” should be used and the\n","specific substance indicated (e.g., . [f.] mild anabolic steroid use disorder). if the\n","substance taken by the individual is unknown, the code for the class “other (or unknown)”\n","should be used (e.g., . [f .] severe unknown substance use disorder). if criteria\n","are met for more than one substance use diso rder, all should be diagnosed (e.g., .\n","[f.] severe heroin use disorder; . [f.] moderate cocaine use disorder).\n","the appropriate icd--cm code for a subs tance use disorder depends on whether\n","there is a comorbid substance-induced disorder  (including intoxication and withdrawal). in\n","the above example, the diagnostic code for moderate alprazolam use disorder, f., re-\n","flects the absence of a comorbid alprazolam -induced mental disorder. because icd--cm\n","codes for substance-induced disorders indicate both the presence (or absence) and severity\n","of the substance use disorder, icd--cm co des for substance use disorders can be used\n","only in the absence of a substance-induced di sorder. see the individu al substance-specific\n","sections for additional coding information.\n","note that the word addiction  is not applied as a diagnostic term in this classification,\n","although it is in common usage in many countr ies to describe severe problems related to\n","compulsive and habitual use of substances. the more neutral term substance use disorder  is\n","used to describe the wide range of the disorder , from a mild form to a severe state of chron-\n","ically relapsing, compulsive drug taking. so me clinicians will choose to use the word ad-\n","diction  to describe more extreme presentations, but the word is omitted from the official\n","dsm- substance use disorder diagnostic term inology because of its uncertain definition\n","and its potentially negative connotation. \n","substance-induced disorders\n","the overall category of subs tance-induced disorders includ es intoxication, withdrawal,\n","and other substance/medication-induced ment al disorders (e.g., substance-induced psy-\n","chotic disorder, substance-in duced depressive disorder).\n","substance intoxication and withdrawal\n","criteria for substance intoxica tion are included within the substance-specific sections of\n","this chapter. the essential fe ature is the development of a reversible substance-specific\n","syndrome due to the recent ingestion of a subs tance (criterion a). the clinically significant\n","problematic behavioral or psychological changes associated with intoxication (e.g., bellig-\n","erence, mood lability, impaired judgment) are attributable to the phy siological effects of\n","the substance on the central nervous system and develop during or shortly after use of the\n","substance (criterion b). the symptoms are not attributable to another medical condition\n","and are not better explained by another mental  disorder (criterion d). substance intoxi-\n","cation is common among those with a substance use disorder but also occurs frequently in\n","individuals without a substance use disorder. this category does not apply to tobacco. \n","the most common changes in intoxication involve disturba nces of perception, wake-\n","fulness, attention, thinking, judgment, psychomotor behavi or, and interpersonal behav-\n","ior. short-term, or “acute,” intoxications may have different signs and symptoms than substance-related and addictive disorders\n","sustained, or “chronic,” intoxications. for example, moderate cocaine doses may initially\n","produce gregariousness, but social withdrawal  may develop if such doses are frequently\n","repeated over days or weeks.\n","when used in the physiological sense, the term intoxication  is broader than substance\n","intoxication as defined here. many substances may produce physiological or psychologi-\n","cal changes that are not necessarily problematic. for example, an individual with tachy-\n","cardia from substance use has a physiological effe ct, but if this is the only symptom in the\n","absence of problematic behavior, the diagnosis of intoxication would not apply. intoxica-\n","tion may sometimes persist beyond the time when the substance is detectable in the body.\n","this may be due to enduring central nervous system effects,  the recovery of which takes\n","longer than the time for elimination of the su bstance. these longer-term effects of intoxi-\n","cation must be distinguished from withdraw al (i.e., symptoms initiated by a decline in\n","blood or tissue concentrat ions of a substance).\n","criteria for substance withdrawal are included within the su bstance-specific sections of\n","this chapter. the essential feat ure is the development of a subs tance-specific problematic be-\n","havioral change, with physiologic al and cognitive concomitants, that is due to the cessation of,\n","or reduction in, heavy and prolonged substance use (criterion a). the substance-specific syn-\n","drome causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc cupational, or other im-\n","portant areas of functioning (criterion c). the symptoms are not due to another medical\n","condition and are not better explained by anot her mental disorder (criterion d). withdrawal\n","is usually, but not always, as sociated with a substance use disorder. most individuals with\n","withdrawal have an urge to re-administe r the substance to reduce the symptoms. \n","route of administration and speed of substance effects\n","routes of administration that produce more rapid and efficient absorption into the blood-\n","stream (e.g., intravenous, smoking, intranasal “snorting”) te nd to result in a more intense\n","intoxication and an increased likelihood of an escalating pattern of substance use leading\n","to withdrawal. similarly, rapi dly acting substances are more likely than slower-acting\n","substances to produce immediate intoxication. \n","duration of effects\n","within the same drug category, relatively sh ort-acting substances tend to have a higher\n","potential for the development of withdrawal th an do those with a longer duration of ac-\n","tion. however, longer-acting substances tend to have longer withdrawal duration. the\n","half-life of the substance parallels aspects of wi thdrawal: the longer the duration of action,\n","the longer the time between cessation and th e onset of withdrawal symptoms and the lon-\n","ger the withdrawal duration. in general, the longer the acute withdrawal period, the less\n","intense the syndrome tends to be.\n","use of multiple substances\n","substance intoxication and withdrawal often involve several substances used simultane-\n","ously or sequentially. in these cases, each diagnosis should be recorded separately.\n","associated laboratory findings\n","laboratory analyses of blood and urine samples can help determine recent use and the specific\n","substances involved. however, a positive laboratory test result do es not by itself indicate that\n","the individual has a pattern of substance use that  meets criteria for a substance-induced or sub-\n","stance use disorder, and a negative test result does not by  itself rule out a diagnosis.\n","laboratory tests can be useful in identify ing withdrawal. if the individual presents\n","with withdrawal from an unknown substance, laboratory tests may help identify the sub-\n","stance and may also be helpful in differentiating withdrawal from other mental disorders.substance-induced disorders \n","in addition, normal functionin g in the presence of high bl ood levels of a substance sug-\n","gests considerable tolerance.\n","development and course\n","individuals ages – years have relatively hi gh prevalence rates for the use of virtually\n","every substance. intoxication is usually the initial substance-related disorder and often be-\n","gins in the teens. withdrawal can occur at any age as long as the relevant drug has been\n","taken in sufficient doses over an extended period of time. \n","recording procedures for intoxication and withdrawal\n","the clinician should use the code that applies to the class of substances but record the\n","name of the specific substance.  for example, the clinician sh ould record .  (f.) seco-\n","barbital withdrawal (rather than sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal) or .\n","(f.) methamphetamine intoxication (rathe r than stimulant intoxication). note that\n","the appropriate icd--cm diagnostic code fo r intoxication depends on whether there is\n","a comorbid substance use diso rder. in this case, the f. code for methamphetamine in-\n","dicates the presence of a comorbid mild methamphetamine use disorder. if there had been\n","no comorbid methamphetamine use disorder , the diagnostic code would have been\n","f.. icd--cm coding rules require th at all withdrawal codes imply a comorbid\n","moderate to severe substance use disorder fo r that substance. in the above case, the code\n","for secobarbital withdrawal (f.) indicates the comorbid presence of a moderate to se-\n","vere secobarbital use disorder . see the coding note for the substance-specific intoxication\n","and withdrawal syndromes for the actual coding options.\n","for substances that do not fit into any of the cl asses (e.g., anabolic steroids), the appropriate\n","code for “other substance intoxication” should be used and the specific substance indicated\n","(e.g., . [f.] anabolic steroid intoxication). if the substance taken by the individual is\n","unknown, the code for the class “other (or unknown)” should be used (e.g., . [f.]\n","unknown substance intoxication). if there are sy mptoms or problems associated with a partic-\n","ular substance but criteria are not met for any of  the substance-specific disorders, the unspec-\n","ified category can be used (e.g., . [f.] unspecified cannabis-related disorder).\n","as noted above, the substance-related codes in icd--cm combine the substance use dis-\n","order aspect of the clinical picture and the su bstance-induced aspect into a single combined\n","code. thus, if both heroin withdrawal and modera te heroin use disorder are present, the single\n","code f. is given to cover both presentati ons. in icd--cm, separate diagnostic codes\n","(. and .) are given to indicate withdr awal and a moderate heroin use disorder, re-\n","spectively. see the individual substance-specific  sections for additional coding information. \n","substance/medication-induced mental disorders\n","the substance/medication-induced mental di sorders are potentially severe, usually tem-\n","porary, but sometimes persisti ng central nervous system (c ns) syndromes that develop\n","in the context of the effects of substances of abuse, medications, or several toxins. they are\n","distinguished from the substance use disorder s, in which a cluster of cognitive, behav-\n","ioral, and physiological symptoms contribute to the continued use of a substance despite\n","significant substance-related problems. the substance/medication-induced mental disor-\n","ders may be induced by the  classes of subs tances that produce su bstance use disorders,\n","or by a great variety of other medications used in medical treatment. each substance-\n","induced mental disorder is desc ribed in the relevant chapter (e.g., “depressive disorders,”\n","“neurocognitive disorders”), an d therefore, only a brief description is offered here. all\n","substance/medication-induced disorders share common characte ristics. it is important to\n","recognize these common features to aid in th e detection of these disorders. these features\n","are described as follows: substance-related and addictive disorders\n","a. the disorder represents a clinically signif icant symptomatic presentation of a relevant\n","mental disorder.\n","b. there is evidence from the history, physical  examination, or laboratory findings of\n","both of the following:\n",". the disorder developed during or within   month of a substance intoxication or\n","withdrawal or taking a medication; and\n",". the involved substance/medication is ca pable of producing th e mental disorder.\n","c. the disorder is not better explained by an in dependent mental disorder (i.e., one that is\n","not substance- or medication-induced). such  evidence of an independent mental dis-\n","order could include the following:\n",". the disorder preceded the onset of severe  intoxication or withdrawal or exposure\n","to the medication; or\n",". the full mental disorder persisted for a substa ntial period of time (e.g., at least  month)\n","after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication or taking the medica-\n","tion. this criterion does not apply to su bstance-induced neurocognitive disorders\n","or hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, which persist beyond the cessation\n","of acute intoxication or withdrawal.\n","d. the disorder does not occur exclusiv ely during the course of a delirium.\n","e. the disorder causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\n","tional, or other important areas of functioning.\n","features\n","some generalizations can be made  regarding the categories of substances capable of produc-\n","ing clinically relevant substance-induced mental disorders. in general, the more sedating\n","drugs (sedative, hypnotics, or anxiolytics, and alcohol) can produce prominent and clini-\n","cally significant depressive disorders during in toxication, while anxiet y conditions are likely\n","to be observed during withdrawal syndromes from these substances. also, during intoxica-\n","tion, the more stimulating substances (e.g., am phetamines and cocaine) are likely to be as-\n","sociated with substance-induced psychoti c disorders and substance-induced anxiety\n","disorders, with substance-indu ced major depressive episodes observed during withdrawal.\n","both the more sedating and mo re stimulating drugs are likely to produce significant but\n","temporary sleep and sexual dist urbances. an overview of the relationship between specific\n","categories of substanc es and specific psychiatric syndromes is presented in table .\n","the medication-induced conditions includ e what are often idiosyncratic cns reac-\n","tions or relatively extreme examples of side effects for a wide range of medications taken\n","for a variety of medical concerns. these includ e neurocognitive complications of anesthet-\n","ics, antihistamines, antihypertensives, and a variety of other medications and toxins (e.g.,\n","organophosphates, insecticides, carbon monoxi de), as described in the chapter on neuro-\n","cognitive disorders. psychotic syndromes may be temporarily experienced in the context\n","of anticholinergic, cardiovascul ar, and steroid drugs, as well  as during use of stimulant-\n","like and depressant-like prescription or over-the-counter drugs. temporary but severe\n","mood disturbances can be observed with a wi de range of medications, including steroids,\n","antihypertensives, disulfiram, and any prescription or over-the- counter depressant or\n","stimulant-like substances. a similar range of medications can be associated with tempo-\n","rary anxiety syndromes, sexual dysfunct ions, and conditions of disturbed sleep.\n","in general, to be considered a substance/ medication-induced mental disorder, there\n","must be evidence that the diso rder being observed is not likely to be better explained by an\n","independent mental condition. the latter are most likely to be seen if the mental disorder\n","was present before the severe intoxication or withdrawal or medication administration, or,\n","with the exception of several substance-induced persisting disorders listed in table , con-\n","tinued more than  month after cessation of acute withdrawal, severe intoxication, or usesubstance-induced disorders \n","of the medications. when symptoms are only  observed during a delirium (e.g., alcohol\n","withdrawal delirium), the mental disorder sh ould be diagnosed as a delirium, and the\n","psychiatric syndrome occurring during the delirium should not also be diagnosed sepa-\n","rately, as many symptoms (including disturba nces in mood, anxiety, and reality testing)\n","are commonly seen during agitated, confused states. the features associated with each rel-\n","evant major mental disorder are similar whether observed with independent or sub-\n","stance/medication-induced mental disorders. however, individuals with substance/\n","medication-induced mental disorders are lik ely to also demonstrate the associated fea-\n","tures seen with the specific category of subs tance or medication, as listed in other subsec-\n","tions of this chapter. \n","development and course\n","substance-induced mental disord ers develop in the context of  intoxication or withdrawal\n","from substances of abuse, and medication-i nduced mental disorders are seen with pre-\n","scribed or over-the-counter medications that are taken at the suggest ed doses. both condi-\n","tions are usually temporary and li kely to disappear with in  month or so of cessation of acute\n","withdrawal, severe intoxication, or use of th e medication. exceptions to these generaliza-\n","tions occur for certain long-d uration substance-in duced disorders: substance-associated\n","neurocognitive disorders that relate to conditions such as alcohol- induced neurocognitive\n","disorder, inhalant-induced neurocognitive disord er, and sedative-, hypnotic-, or anxiolytic-\n","induced neurocognitive disorder; and hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (“flash-\n","backs”; see the section “hallucinogen-related disorders” later in this chapter). however,\n","most other substance/medication -induced mental disorders, re gardless of the severity of\n","the symptoms, are likely to impr ove relatively quickly with ab stinence and unlikely to re-\n","main clinically relevant for more than  month after complete cessation of use.\n","as is true of many consequences of heavy substance use, some individuals are more\n","and others less prone toward specific substance-induced disorders. similar types of pre-\n","dispositions may make some individuals more likely to develop psychiatric side effects of\n","some types of medications, but not others. however, it is unclear whether individuals\n","with family histories or personal prior hist ories with independent psychiatric syndromes\n","are more likely to develop the induced synd rome once the consideration is made as to\n","whether the quantity and frequency of the substance was sufficient to lead to the devel-\n","opment of a substanc e-induced syndrome.\n","there are indications that the intake of su bstances of abuse or some medications with\n","psychiatric side effects in the context of a pree xisting mental disorder is likely to result in\n","an intensification of the preexisting indepe ndent syndrome. the risk for substance/med-\n","ication-induced mental disorders is likely to increase with both the quantity and the fre-\n","quency of consumption of  the relevant substance.\n","the symptom profiles for the substance/medication-induced mental disorders resem-\n","ble independent mental disorders. while the symptoms of substance/medication-in-\n","duced mental disorders can be identical to those of independent mental disorders (e.g.,\n","delusions, hallucinations, psychoses, major de pressive episodes, anxiety syndromes), and\n","although they can have the same severe conseq uences (e.g., suicide) , most induced mental\n","disorders are likely to improve in a matt er of days to weeks of abstinence.\n","the substance/medication-induced mental di sorders are an important part of the dif-\n","ferential diagnoses for the independent psychiatric conditions. the importance of recog-\n","nizing an induced mental disorder is similar to the relevance of identifying the possible\n","role of some medical conditions and medication reaction s before diagnosing an indepen-\n","dent mental disorder. symptoms of substanc e- and medication-induced mental disorders\n","may be identical cross-sectionally to those of  independent mental disorders but have dif-\n","ferent treatments and prognoses from the independent condition.  substance-related and addictive disorders\n","functional consequences of substance/medication-\n","induced mental disorders\n","the same consequences related to the relevant  independent mental disorder (e.g., suicide\n","attempts) are likely to apply to the substance/medi cation-induced mental disorders, but\n","these are likely to disappear within  month after abstinence. similarly, the same func-\n","tional consequences associated with the relevant substance use disorder are likely to be seen\n","for the substance-indu ced mental disorders.\n","recording procedures fo r substance/medication-\n","induced mental disorders\n","coding notes and separate recording procedures for icd--cm and icd--cm codes for\n","other specific substance/medi cation-induced mental diso rders are provided in other\n","chapters of the manual with disorders with  which they share phenomenology (see the sub-\n","stance/medication-indu ced mental disorders in these chapters: “schizophrenia spectrum\n","and other psychotic disorders,” “bipolar and related disorders,” “depressive disor-\n","ders,” “anxiety disorders,” “obsessive-compulsive and related disorders,” “sleep-\n","wake disorders,” “sexual dysfunctions,” and “neurocognitive disorders”). generally,\n","for icd--cm, if a mental disorder is induced by a substance use disorder, a separate di-\n","agnostic code is given for the specific substance use disorder, in addition  to the code for the\n","substance/medication-induced mental disord er. for icd--cm, a single code combines\n","the substance-induced mental disorder with the substance use disorder. a separate diag-\n","nosis of the comorbid substance use disorder is  not given, although the name and severity\n","of the specific substance use disorder (whe n present) are used when recording the sub-\n","stance/medication-induced mental disorder. icd--cm codes are also provided for sit-\n","uations in which the substance/ medication-induced mental di sorder is not induced by a\n","substance use disorder (e.g., when a disorder is induced by one-time use of a substance or\n","medication). additional  information needed to record the diagnostic name of the sub-\n","stance/medication-induce d mental disorder is provided in the sect ion “recording proce-\n","dures” for each substance/medication-induced mental disorder in its respective chapter.\n","alcohol-related disorders\n","alcohol use disorder\n","alcohol intoxication\n","alcohol withdrawal\n","other alcohol-induced disorders\n","unspecified alcohol-related

the following, occurring within a -month period:\n",". alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.\n",". there is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.\n","Substance-Related Disorders.pdf\n","disruptive, impulse-control,\n","and conduct disorders\n","disruptive, impulse-control,  and conduct disorders include conditions involv-\n","ing problems in the self-control of emotions  and behaviors. while other disorders in dsm-\n"," may also involve problems in  emotional and/or behavioral  regulation, the disorders in\n","this chapter are unique in that these problems  are manifested in behaviors that violate the\n","rights of others (e.g., aggression, destructio n of property) and/or that bring the individual\n","into significant conflict with societal norms or  authority figures. the underlying causes of\n","the problems in the self-control of emotions  and behaviors can vary greatly across the dis-\n","orders in this chapter and among individu als within a given diagnostic category. \n","the chapter includes opposition al defiant disorder, intermi ttent explosive disorder, con-\n","duct disorder, antisocial person ality disorder (which is described in the chapter “personality\n","disorders”), pyromania, kleptomania, and ot her specified and unspecified disruptive, im-\n","pulse-control, and conduct disorders. althou gh all the disorders in the chapter involve\n","problems in both emotional and behavioral re gulation, the source of variation among the\n","disorders is the relative emphas is on problems in the two types of self-control. for example,\n","the criteria for conduct disorder focus largely on poorly controlled behaviors that violate the\n","rights of others or that violat e major societal norms. many of  the behavioral symptoms (e.g.,\n","aggression) can be a result of poorly controlled  emotions such as anger. at the other extreme,\n","the criteria for intermittent explosive disorder  focus largely on such poorly controlled emo-\n","tion, outbursts of anger that are disproportionate to the interpersonal or other provocation\n","or to other psychosocial  stressors. intermediate in impact to these two disorders is opposi-\n","tional defiant disorder, in which the criteria  are more evenly distributed between emotions\n","(anger and irritation) and be haviors (argumentati veness and defiance). pyromania and\n","kleptomania are less commonly used diagnoses characterized by poor impulse control re-\n","lated to specific behaviors (fire setting or stealing) that reliev e internal tension. other speci-\n","fied disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder is a category for conditions in which\n","there are symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or other disruptive,\n","impulse-control, and conduct disorders, but th e number of symptoms does not meet the di-\n","agnostic threshold for any of th e disorders in this chapter, even though there is evidence of\n","clinically significant impairment  associated with the symptoms. \n","the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders all tend to be more common in\n","males than in females, although the relative degree of male predominance may differ both\n","across disorders and within a disorder at differe nt ages. the disorders in  this chapter tend to\n","have first onset in childhood or adolescence. in fact, it is very rare for ei ther conduct disorder or\n","oppositional defiant disorder to first emerge in adulthood. there is a developmental relation-\n","ship between oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, in th at most cases of con-\n","duct disorder previously would have met criteria for opposition al defiant disorder, at least in\n","those cases in which conduct disorder emerges prior to adolescence. however, most children\n","with oppositional defiant disorder do not ev entually develop conduct disorder. furthermore,\n","children with opposition al defiant disorder are at risk fo r eventually developing other prob-\n","lems besides conduct disorder, includ ing anxiety and depr essive disorders.\n","many of the symptoms that define the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disor-\n","ders are behaviors that can occur to some degree in typically developing individuals.\n","thus, it is critical that the frequency, persistence , pervasiveness across situations, and im- disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders\n","pairment associated with the behaviors indica tive of the diagnosis be considered relative\n","to what is normative for a person’s age, gend er, and culture when determining if they are\n","symptomatic of a disorder. \n","the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduc t disorders have been linked to a common\n","externalizing spectrum associated with the personality dimensions labeled as disinhibition\n","and (inversely) constraint  and, to a lesser extent, negative emotionality. these shared per-\n","sonality dimensions could acco unt for the high level of como rbidity among these disorders\n","and their frequent

sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this pe-\n","riod, then the diagnosis of major depression shou ld be noted, but it is coded not as a separate\n","diagnosis

of “with intermittent major depressi ve episodes, with current episode” would be\n","made. if the major depressive episode has pers isted for at least a -year duration and re-\n","mains present, then the specifie r “with persistent major depressive episode” is used. when\n","full major depressive episode cr iteria are not currently met but there has been at least one\n","previous episode of major

be\n","characterized by attention seeking, manipulati ve behavior, and rapidly shifting emotions,\n","it is distinguished by self-destructiveness, angry disruptions in close relationships,

however, such symptoms  should not count as\n","one of the four required symptoms. panic attacks can occur in the context of any mental\n","disorder (e.g., anxiety disorder s, depressive disorders, bipola r disorders, eating disorders,\n","obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality di sorders, psychotic disorders,\n","substance use disorders) and some medical cond itions (e.g., cardiac,  respiratory, vestibu-\n","lar, gastrointestinal), with the majority ne ver meeting criteria for panic disorder. recur-\n","rent unexpected panic attacks are requir ed for a diagnosis of panic disorder. \n","associated features \n","one type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack  (i.e., waking from sleep in a\n","state of panic), which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep. panic attacks\n","are related to a higher rate of  suicide attempts and suicidal ideation even when comorbid-\n","ity and other suicide risk fa ctors are taken into account.\n","prevalence\n","in the general population, -month prevalen ce estimates for panic attacks in the united\n","states is .% in adults. twelve-month preval ence estimates do not appear to differ sig-\n","nificantly among african americans, asian americans, and latinos. lower -month\n","prevalence estimates for european countries ap pear to range from .% to .%. females\n","are more frequently affected than males, al though this gender difference is more pro-\n","nounced for panic disorder. panic attacks can oc cur in children but are relatively rare until\n","the age of puberty, when the prevalence rates increase. the prevalence rates decline in\n","older individuals, possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels.\n","development and course\n","the mean age at onset for panic attacks in the united states is approximately – years\n","among adults. however, the course of panic at tacks is likely influenced by the course of\n","any co-occurring mental disorder(s) and stre ssful life events. panic attacks are uncommon,\n","and unexpected panic attacks are rare, in preadolescent children . adolescents might be\n","less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks, even though they present with ep-\n","isodes of intense fear or discom fort. lower prevalence of pani c attacks in older individuals\n","may be related to a weaker autonomic response to emotional states re lative to younger in-\n","dividuals. older individuals may be less inclin ed to use the word “fear” and more inclined anxiety disorders\n","to use the word “discomfort” to describe pa nic attacks. older individuals with “panicky\n","feelings” may have a hybrid of limited-sym ptom attacks and generalized anxiety. in\n","addition, older individuals tend  to attribute panic attacks to  certain situations that are\n","stressful (e.g., medical procedures, social se ttings) and may retrospectively endorse expla-\n","nations for the panic attack even if it was un expected in the moment. this may result in un-\n","der-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals. \n","risk and prognostic factors \n","temperamental. negative affectivity (neuroticism) (i .e., proneness to experiencing neg-\n","ative emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i.e., the disposition to believe that symptoms of\n","anxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks. history of “fearful\n","spells” (i.e., limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full criteria for a panic attack) may\n","be a risk factor for later panic attacks. \n","environmental. smoking is a risk factor for panic atta cks. most individu als report iden-\n","tifiable stressors in the months before their first panic attack (e.g., interpersonal stressors\n","and stressors related to physical well-being,  such as negative experiences with illicit or\n","prescription drugs, disease,  or death in the family). \n","culture-related diagnostic issues\n","cultural interpretations may in fluence the determination of panic attacks as expected or\n","unexpected. culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and un-\n","controllable screaming or crying) may be seen ; however, such symptoms should not count\n","as one of the four required symptoms. frequency of each of the  symptoms varies cross-\n","culturally (e.g., higher rates of paresthesias in african americans and of dizziness in sev-\n","eral asian groups). cultural syndromes also influence the cross-cultural presentation of\n","panic attacks, resulting in different symptom profiles across different cultural groups. ex-\n","amples include khyâl  (wind) attacks, a cambodian cultural syndrome involving dizziness,\n","tinnitus, and neck soreness; and trúng gió  (wind-related) attacks,  a vietnamese cultural\n","syndrome associated with headaches. ataque de nervios (attack of nerves) is a cultural syn-\n","drome among latin americans that may invo lve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or\n","crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization, and which\n","may be experienced for longer than only a few minutes. some clinical presentations of\n","ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for conditions other than panic attack (e.g., other specified\n","dissociative disorder). also, cu ltural expectations may influe nce the classification of panic\n","attacks as expected or unexpected, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situa-\n","tions, ranging from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios ), to types of\n","exertion (associated with khyâl attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with trúng gió  at-\n","tacks). clarification of the details of cultural  attributions may aid in distinguishing ex-\n","pected and unexpected panic attacks. for more information ab out cultural syndromes, see\n","“glossary of cultural concepts of distress” in the appendix to this manual.\n","gender-related diagnostic issues\n","panic attacks are more common in  females than in males, but clinical features or symp-\n","toms of panic attacks do not di ffer between males and females.\n","diagnostic markers\n","physiological recordings of naturally occurring panic attacks in individuals with panic\n","disorder indicate abrupt surges  of arousal, usually of heart rate, that reach a peak within\n","minutes and subside within minu tes, and for a proportion of  these individu als the panic\n","attack may be preceded by cardiorespiratory instabilities.agoraphobia \n","functional consequenc es of panic attacks\n","in the context of co-occurring mental disord ers, including anxiety disorders, depressive\n","disorders, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, psychoti c disorders, and personality\n","disorders, panic attacks are associated with  increased symptom severity, higher rates of\n","comorbidity and suicidality, and poorer trea tment response. also, full-symptom panic at-\n","tacks typically are associated wi th greater morbidity (e.g., gr eater health care utilization,\n","more disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks. \n","differential diagnosis\n","other paroxysmal episodes (e.g., “anger attacks”). panic attacks should not be diag-\n","nosed if the episodes do not involve the essent ial feature of an abrupt surge of intense fear\n","or intense discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e.g ., anger, grief).\n","anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. medical conditions that can cause\n","or be misdiagnosed as panic attacks include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheo-\n","chromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, se izure disorders, and cardiopulmonary con-\n","ditions (e.g., arrhythmias, supraventricular  tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive\n","pulmonary disease). appropriate laboratory tests (e.g., serum calcium levels for hyperpara-\n","thyroidism;

period of time.\n","diagnostic features\n","avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends the dsm-iv diagnosis of\n","feeding disorder of infancy or  early childhood. the main diagnostic feature of avoidant/\n","restrictive food intake disorder is avoidance or restriction of food intake (criterion a)\n","manifested by clinically significant failure to  meet requirements for nutrition or insuffi-\n","cient energy intake through oral intake of food. one or more of the following key features\n","must be present: significant weight loss, si gnificant nutritional deficiency (or related\n","health impact), dependence on enteral feedin g or oral nutritional supplements, or marked\n","interference with psychosocial functioning.  the determination of whether weight loss is\n","significant (criterion a) is a clinical judgme nt; instead of losing weight, children and ad-\n","olescents who have not completed growth may not maintain weight or height increases\n","along their developmental trajectory.\n","determination of significant nu tritional deficiency (criterion a) is also based on clin-\n","ical assessment (e.g., assessment of dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory\n","testing), and related impact on physical health can be of a similar seve rity to that seen in\n","anorexia nervosa (e.g., hypother mia, bradycardia, anemia). in severe cases, particularly in\n","infants, malnutrition can be life threatening.  “dependence” on enteral feeding or oral nu-\n","tritional supplements (criterion a) means that  supplementary feeding is required to sus-\n","tain adequate intake. examples of individu als requiring supplementary feeding include\n","infants with failure to thrive who require na sogastric tube feeding, children with neuro-\n","developmental disorders who are dependent on  nutritionally complete supplements, and\n","individuals who rely on gastrostomy tube feeding or complete oral nutrition supplements\n","in the absence of an underlying medical condit ion. inability to participate in normal socialavoidant/restrictive food intake disorder \n","activities, such as eating with others, or to sustain relationsh ips as a result of the distur-\n","bance would indicate marked interference wi th psychosocial functioning (criterion a).\n","avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not include avoidance or restriction of\n","food intake related to lack of availability of food or to cultural practices (e.g., religious fast-\n","ing or normal dieting) (criterion b), nor does it include developmentally normal behaviors\n","(e.g., picky eating in toddlers, reduced intake in older adults). the disturbance is not better\n","explained by excessive concern about body weight  or shape (criterion c) or by concurrent\n","medical factors or mental disorders (criterion d). \n","in some individuals, food av oidance or restriction may be based on the sensory char-\n","acteristics of qualities of fo od, such as extreme sensitivity to appearance, color, smell,\n","texture, temperature, or taste. such behavior  has been described as  “restrictive eating,”\n","“selective eating,” “choosy eating,” “perseverant eating,” “chronic food refusal,” and\n","“food neophobia” and may manifest as refusal to  eat particular brands of foods or to tol-\n","erate the smell of food being eaten by others . individuals with heightened sensory sensi-\n","tivities associated with autism  may show similar behaviors. \n","food avoidance or restriction may also repr esent a conditioned negative response as-\n","sociated with food intake following, or in an ticipation of, an aversive experience, such as\n","choking; a traumatic investigation, usually invo lving the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., esoph-\n","agoscopy); or repeated vomiting. the terms functional dysphagia and globus hystericus  have\n","also been used for such conditions. \n","associated features supporting diagnosis \n","several features may be associated with food avoidance or reduced food intake, including\n","a lack of interest in eating or food, leading to weight loss or faltering growth. very young\n","infants may present as being too sleepy, distre ssed, or agitated to feed. infants and young\n","children may not engage with the primary ca regiver during feeding or communicate hun-\n","ger in favor of other activities. in older child ren and adolescents, food  avoidance or restric-\n","tion may be associated with more generali zed emotional difficulties that do not meet\n","diagnostic criteria for an an xiety, depressive, or bipolar disorder, sometimes called “food\n","avoidance emotional disorder.” \n","development and course\n","food avoidance or restriction associated with in sufficient intake or lack of interest in eat-\n","ing most commonly develops in infancy or early childhood and may persist in adulthood.\n","likewise, avoidance based on sensory characterist ics of food tends to arise in the first de-\n","cade of life but may persist into adulthood. avoidance related to aversive consequences\n","can arise at any age. the scant literature re garding long-term outcomes suggests that food\n","avoidance or restriction based on sensory aspects is relatively stable and long-standing,\n","but when persisting into adulthood, such avoidance/restriction can be associated with rel-\n","atively normal functioning. there is currently insufficient evidence directly linking avoid-\n","ant/restrictive food intake disorder and subsequent onset of an eating disorder. \n","infants with avoidant/restrictive food intake  disorder may be irritable and difficult to\n","console during feeding, or ma y appear apathetic and withdrawn. in some instances, par-\n","ent-child interaction may contri bute to the infant’s feeding problem (e.g., presenting food\n","inappropriately, or interpreting the infant’s be havior as an act of aggression or rejection).\n","inadequate nutritional intake may exacerbate the associated fe atures (e.g., irritability, de-\n","velopmental lags) and further contribute to f eeding difficulties. associated factors include\n","infant temperament or developm ental impairments that reduce  an infant’s responsiveness\n","to feeding. coexisting parental psychopathology, or child abus e or neglect, is suggested if\n","feeding and weight improve in response to ch anging caregivers. in infants, children, and\n","prepubertal adolescents, avoidant/restrictive food intake di sorder may be associated with\n","growth delay, and the resulting malnutrition  negatively affects development and learning feeding and eating disorders\n","potential. in older children, adolescents, an d adults, social functioning tends to be ad-\n","versely affected. regardless of the age, fami ly function may be affected, with heightened\n","stress at mealtimes and in other feeding or ea ting contexts involving friends and relatives.\n","avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder  manifests more commonly in children than\n","in adults, and there may be a long delay betw een onset and

con-\n","sistent with a medical condition; the eating d isturbance may also persis t after being triggered\n","by a medical condition and following resolution of the medical condition. \n","underlying medical or comorbid mental cond itions may complicate  feeding and eating.\n","because older individuals, postsurgical pati ents, and individuals receiving chemotherapy\n","often lose their appetite, an additional diagno sis of avoidant/restric tive food intake dis-\n","order requires that the eating disturbance is a primary focus for intervention. \n","specific neurological/neuromuscular,

to problems with oral/esophageal/\n","pharyngeal structure and function, such as hy potonia of musculature, tongue protrusion,\n","and unsafe swallowing. avoidant/restrictive food  intake disorder can

phobia from avoidant/res trictive food intake disorder can be dif-\n","ficult when a fear of choking or vomiting h as resulted in food avoidance. although avoid-\n","ance or restriction of food intake secondar y to a pronounced fear of choking or vomiting\n","can be conceptualized as specific phobia, in  situations when the eating problem becomes\n","the primary focus of clinical attention, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder becomes\n","the appropriate diagnosis. in social anxiety disorder, the individual  may present with a\n","fear of being observed by others while eating , which can also occur in avoidant/restrictive\n","food intake disorder. \n","anorexia nervosa. restriction of energy intake relati ve to requirements  leading to sig-\n","nificantly low body weight is a core featur e of anorexia nervosa.  however, individuals\n","with anorexia nervosa also display a fear of ga ining weight or of becoming fat, or persis-\n","tent behavior that interferes with weight gain , as well as specific disturbances in relation to\n","perception and experience of their own body weight and shape. these features are not\n","present in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the two disorders should not be\n","diagnosed concurrently. differential diagnosis between avoidant/restrictive food intake\n","disorder and anorexia nervosa may be difficult,  especially in late childhood and early ad-\n","olescence, because these disorders may share a number of common symptoms (e.g., food\n","avoidance, low weight). differential diagnosis is also potentially difficult in individuals\n","with anorex ia nervosa who deny any fear of fatness but nonetheless engage in persistent\n","behaviors that prevent weight gain and who do not recognize the medical seriousness of\n","their low weight—a presentation sometimes termed “non-fat phobic anorexia nervosa.”\n","full consideration of symptoms, course, and fa mily history is advised, and diagnosis may feeding and eating disorders\n","be best made in the context of a clinical rela tionship over time. in some individuals, avoid-\n","ant/restrictive food intake disorder might precede the onset of anorexia nervosa.\n","obsessive-compulsive disorder. individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder may\n","present with avoidance or restri ction of intake in relation to preoccupations with food

is\n","a major aspect of the clinical presenta tion requiring specific intervention.\n","major depressive disorder. in major depressive disorder, a ppetite might be affected to\n","such an extent that individuals present with significantly restricted food intake, usually in\n","relation to overall energy intake and often a ssociated with weight loss. usually appetite\n","loss and related reduction of intake abate wi th resolution of mood problems. avoidant/\n","restrictive food intake disorder should only be used concurrently if fu ll criteria are met for\n","both disorders and when the eating d isturbance requires specific treatment.\n","schizophrenia spectrum disorders. individuals with schizophrenia, delusional disor-\n","der, or other psychotic disorders may exhibit odd eating behaviors, avoidance of specific\n","foods because of delusional beliefs, or other ma nifestations of avoidant or restrictive in-\n","take. in some cases, delusional beliefs may contribute to a concern about negative conse-\n","quences of ingesting certain foods. avoidant/r estrictive food intake disorder should be\n","used concurrently only if all criteria are me t for both disorders and

induce\n","physical symptoms such as failure to gain weig ht. as with any diagno sis of factitious dis-\n","order imposed on another, the caregiver receives the diagnosis rather than the affected

(cri-\n","terion c under “bipolar ii disorder”). the de pressive episodes or hypomanic fluctuations\n","must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or

ep-\n","isodes are often more frequent and lengthier than those occurring in bipolar i disorder.\n","individuals with bipolar ii d isorder typically present to a clinician during a major de-\n","pressive episode and are unlikely to complain  initially of hypomania. typically, the hy-\n","pomanic episodes themselves do not cause im pairment. instead, th e impairment results\n","from the major depressive episodes or from a persistent pattern of unpredictable mood\n","changes and fluctuating, unreliable interperso nal or occupational functioning. individu-\n","als with bipolar ii disorder may not view the hypomanic episodes as pathological or dis-\n","advantageous, although others may be troubled by the indi vidual’s erratic behavior.\n","clinical information from other

confused wi th the several days of euthymia and re-\n","stored energy or activity that may follow remiss ion of a major depressive  episode. despite the\n","substantial differences in duration and severi ty between a manic and hypomanic episode, bi-\n","polar ii disorder is not a “milder form” of bipo lar i disorder. compared with individuals with\n","bipolar i disorder, individuals with bipolar ii di sorder have greater chronicity of illness and\n","spend, on average, more time in the depressive phase of their illness, which can be severe and/\n","or disabling. depressive symptoms co-occurr ing with a hypomanic episode or hypomanic\n","symptoms co-occurring with a depressive episod e are common in individuals with bipolar ii\n","disorder and are overrepresented in females, pa rticularly hypomania with mixed features. in-\n","dividuals experiencing hypomania with mixed fe atures may not label their symptoms as hy-\n","pomania, but instead experience them as depr ession with increased energy or irritability.\n","associated features supporting diagnosis\n","a common feature of bipolar ii disorder is impulsivity, which can contribute to suicide at-\n","tempts and substance use disorders. impulsivit y may also stem from a concurrent person-\n","ality disorder, substance use disorder, anxiet y disorder, another mental disorder, or a\n","medical condition. there may be heightened levels of creativity in some individuals with\n","a bipolar disorder. however, that relationship  may be nonlinear; th at is, greater lifetime\n","creative accomplishments have been associated  with milder forms of  bipolar disorder, and\n","higher creativity has been f ound in unaffected family members. the individual’s attach-\n","ment to heightened creativity during hypomanic episodes may contribute to ambivalence\n","about seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment. \n","prevalence\n","the -month prevalence of bipolar ii disord er, internationally, is  .%. in the united\n","states, -month prevalence is .%. the prevalence rate of pediatric bipolar ii disorder is\n","difficult to establish. dsm-iv bipolar i, bipola r ii, and bipolar disorder not otherwise spec-\n","ified yield a combined prevalence rate of . % in u.s. and non-u.s. community samples,\n","with higher rates (.% inclusive) in youths age  years or older. \n","development and course\n","although bipolar ii disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, av-\n","erage age at onset is the mid-s, which is slight ly later than for bipolar i disorder but ear-\n","lier than for major depressive  disorder. the illness most of ten begins with a depressive\n","episode and is not recognized as bipolar ii d isorder until a hypomanic episode occurs; this\n","happens in about % of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disor-\n","der. anxiety, substance use, or eating diso rders may also precede the diagnosis, compli-\n","cating its detection. many individuals expe rience several episodes of major depression\n","prior to the first recognized hypomanic episode. \n","the number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanic and major depressive episodes)\n","tends to be higher for bipolar ii disorder than for major depressive disorder or bipolar i\n","disorder. however, individuals with bipolar i disorder are actually more likely to experi-\n","ence hypomanic symptoms than  are individuals with bipolar ii disorder.the interval\n","between mood episodes in the co urse of bipolar ii disorder tends to decrease as the indi-\n","vidual ages. while the hypomanic episode is the feature that defines bipolar ii disorder,\n","depressive episodes are more enduring and disabling over time. despite the predomi-\n","nance of depression, once a hypomanic epis ode has occurred, the diagnosis becomes bi-\n","polar ii disorder and never reve rts to major depressive disorder.\n","approximately %–% of individuals with bipolar ii disorder ha ve multiple (four or\n","more) mood episodes (hypomanic or major depressive) within the previous  months. ifbipolar ii disorder \n","this pattern is present, it is noted by the specifier “with rapid cycling.” by definition, psy-\n","chotic symptoms do not occur in hypomanic episodes, and they appear to be less frequent\n","in the major depressive episodes in bipolar ii di sorder than in those of bipolar i disorder. \n","switching from a depressive episode to a manic or hypomanic episode (with or with-\n","out mixed features) may occur, both spontane ously and during treatment for depression.\n","about %–% of individuals with bipolar ii disorder will ultimately develop a manic ep-\n","isode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar i disorder, regardless of  subsequent course. \n","making the diagnosis in children is often a challenge, especially in those with irritabil-\n","ity and hyperarousal that is nonepisodic  (i.e., lacks the well-demarcated periods of altered\n","mood). nonepisodic irritability in  youth is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety dis-\n","orders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar disorder, in ad ulthood. persistently\n","irritable youths have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than do  youths who have bi-\n","polar disorder. for a hypomanic episode to be  diagnosed, the child’s symptoms must ex-\n","ceed what is expected in a given environment and culture for the child’s developmental\n","stage. compared with adult onset of bipolar ii disorder, childhood or  adolescent onset of\n","the disorder may be associated with a more severe lifetime course. the -year incidence\n","rate of first-onset bipolar ii disorder in adults older than  years is .%. however, dis-\n","tinguishing individuals older than  years with bipolar ii disorder by late versus early\n","age at onset does not appear to have any clinical utility.\n","risk and prognostic factors\n","genetic and physiological. the risk of bipolar ii disorder  tends to be highest among rel-\n","atives of individuals with bipolar ii disorder, as opposed to individuals with bipolar i dis-\n","order or major depressive disorder. there ma y be genetic factors influencing the age at\n","onset for bipolar disorders.\n","course modifiers. a rapid-cycling pattern is associated  with a poorer prognosis. return\n","to previous level of social fu nction for individuals with bipolar ii disorder is more likely\n","for individuals of younger age and with less severe depression, sugge sting adverse effects\n","of prolonged illness on recovery. more education, fewer ye ars of illness, and being mar-\n","ried are independently associated with functi onal recovery in individuals with bipolar\n","disorder, even after diagnostic  type (i vs. ii), current depressive symptoms, and presence\n","of psychiatric comorbidity are taken into account.\n","gender-related diagnostic issues\n","whereas the gender ratio for bipolar i disorder is equal, findings on gender differences in\n","bipolar ii disorder are mixed, differing by type of sample (i.e., registry, community, or\n","clinical) and country of origin. there is little to  no evidence of bipolar gender differences,\n","whereas some, but not all, clinical samples su ggest that bipolar ii disorder is more com-\n","mon in females than in males, which may refl ect gender differences in treatment seeking\n","or other factors. \n","patterns of illness and comorbidity, however,  seem to differ by gender, with females\n","being more likely than males to report hypomania with mixed depressive features and a\n","rapid-cycling course. childbirth may be a spec ific trigger for a hypomanic episode, which\n","can occur in %–% of females in nonclinical populations and most typically in the early\n","postpartum period. distinguishing hypomani a from the elated mood and reduced sleep\n","that normally accompany the birth of a chil d may be challenging. postpartum hypomania\n","may foreshadow the onset of a depression that occurs in abou t half of females who expe-\n","rience postpartum “highs.” accurate detectio n of bipolar ii disorder may help in estab-\n","lishing appropriate treatment of the depression , which may reduce the risk of suicide and\n","infanticide.  bipolar and related disorders\n","suicide risk\n","suicide risk is high in bipolar ii disorder. approximately one-third of individuals with bi-\n","polar ii disorder report a lifetime history of suicide attempt. the prev alence rates of life-\n","time attempted suicide in bipolar ii and bipola r i disorder appear to be similar (.% and\n",".%, respectively). however, the lethality of attempts, as defined by a lower ratio of at-\n","tempts to completed suicides, may be higher in individuals with bipolar ii disorder com-\n","pared with individuals with bipolar i disorder. there may be an association between\n","genetic markers and increased risk for suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar dis-\n","order, including a .-fold higher risk of su icide among first-degree relatives of bipolar ii\n","probands compared with those with bipolar i disorder. \n","functional consequences  of bipolar ii disorder\n","although many in dividuals with bipolar ii disorder return to a fully functional level be-\n","tween mood episodes, at least % continue to have some in ter-episode dysfunction, and\n","% transition directly into another mood episode without inter-ep isode recovery. func-\n","tional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms of bipolar ii disorder,\n","especially in regard to occupational recovery , resulting in lower socioeconomic status de-\n","spite equivalent levels of education with the general population. individuals with bipolar\n","ii disorder perform more  poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests and, with the\n","exception of memory and semantic fluency, ha ve similar cognitive impairment as do in-\n","dividuals with bipolar i disord er. cognitive impairments associ ated with bipolar ii disor-\n","der may contribute to vocational difficulti es. prolonged unemployment in individuals\n","with bipolar disorder is associated with more episodes of depression, older age, increased\n","rates of current panic disorder, and lif etime history of alcohol use disorder.\n","differential diagnosis \n","major depressive disorder. perhaps the most challenging differential diagnosis to con-\n","sider is major depressive di sorder, which may be accompanied by hypomanic or manic\n","symptoms that do not meet full criteria (i.e., either fewer symptoms or a shorter duration\n","than required for a hypomanic episode). this is  especially true in evaluating individuals\n","with symptoms of irritability, which may be associated with either  major depressive dis-\n","order or bipolar ii disorder. \n","cyclothymic disorder. in cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous periods of hypo-\n","manic symptoms and numerous periods of depr essive symptoms that do not meet symp-\n","tom or duration criteria for a major depressive  episode. bipolar ii disorder is distinguished\n","from cyclothymic disorder by the presence of  one or more major depressive episodes. if a\n","major depressive episode occurs after the firs t  years of cyclothymic disorder, the addi-\n","tional diagnosis of bipolar ii disorder is given.\n","schizophrenia spectrum and other related psychotic disorders. bipolar ii disorder must\n","be distinguished from psychotic disorders (e .g., schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia,\n","and delusional disorder). sc hizophrenia, schizoaffective di sorder, and delusional disor-\n","der are all characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of\n","prominent mood symptoms. other helpful considerations incl ude the accompanying\n","symptoms, previous cour se, and family history.\n","panic disorder or other anxiety disorders. anxiety disorders need to be considered in\n","the differential diagnosis and may

gonadotropin-releasing\n","hormone [gnrh] analog, spironolactone). clinically refe rred adolescents often want hor-\n","mone treatment and many also wish for gender reassignment surgery. adolescents

adolescents,\n","when sexually active, usually do  not show or allow partners to touch their sexual organs. for\n","adults with an aversion toward their genitals, sexual activity is constrained by the preference\n","that their genitals not be seen  or touched by their partners. some adults may seek hormone\n","treatment (sometimes without medical prescrip tion and supervision) and gender reassign-\n","ment surgery. others are satisfied with either hormone treatment or surgery alone.\n","adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria before gender reassignment are at in-\n","creased risk

typically developing\n","boys and girls. young children are less likely than older children, ad olescents, and adults\n","to express extreme and persistent anatomic dysphoria. in adolescents and adults, incon-\n","gruence between experienced gender and somati c sex is a central feature of the diagnosis.\n","factors related to distress and impairment al so vary with age. a very young child may\n","show signs of distress (e.g., intense crying) on ly when parents tell the child that he or she\n","is “really” not a member of the other gender but only “desires” to be. distress may not be\n","manifest in social environments supportive of the child’s desire to live in the role of the\n","other gender and may emerge only if the desi re is interfered with. in adolescents and\n","adults, distress may manifest because of stro ng incongruence between experienced gender\n","and somatic sex. such distress may, however, be mitigated by  supportive environments and\n","knowledge that biomedical treatments exist to reduce incongruence. impairment (e.g.,\n","school refusal, development of  depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) may be a conse-\n","quence of gender dysphoria.\n","gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development. for clinic-referred children,\n","onset of cross-gender behaviors is usually betw een ages  and  years. this corresponds to\n","the developmental time period in which most  typically developing children begin ex-\n","pressing gendered behaviors and interests. for some preschool-age children, both perva-\n","sive cross-gender behaviors and the expressed desire to be the other gender may be\n","present, or, more rarely, labeling oneself as a member of the other gender may occur. in\n","some cases, the expressed desire to be the othe r gender appears later, usually at entry into\n","elementary school. a small minority of childre n express discomfort wi th their sexual anat-\n","omy or will state the desire to have a sexual anatomy correspondin g to the experienced\n","gender (“anatomic dysphoria”). expressions of anatomic dysphoria become more com-\n","mon as children with ge nder dysphoria approach and anticipate puberty. \n","rates of persistence of gender dysphoria fr om childhood into adolescence or adulthood\n","vary. in natal males, persistence has ranged fr om .% to %. in natal females, persistence\n","has ranged from % to %. persistence of gender dysphoria is mo destly correlated with\n","dimensional measures of severity ascertaine d at the time of a childhood baseline assess-\n","ment. in one sample of natal males, lower socioeconomic background was also modestly\n","correlated with persistence. it is unclear if particular therapeutic approaches to gender\n","dysphoria in children are related to rates of  long-term persistence. extant follow-up sam-\n","ples consisted of children receiving no formal  therapeutic interventi on or receiving ther-\n","apeutic interventions of various types, ranging from ac tive efforts to reduce gender\n","dysphoria to a more neutral, “watchful waiting” approach. it is unclear if children “en-\n","couraged” or supported to live socially in the desired gender will show  higher rates of per-\n","sistence, since such children have not yet b een followed longitudinally in a systematic\n","manner. for both natal male and female ch ildren showing persistence, almost all are\n","sexually attracted to individuals of their na tal sex. for natal male  children whose gender\n","dysphoria does not per sist, the majority are androphilic  (sexually attracted to males) and of-\n","ten self-identify as gay or homosexual (rangi ng from % to %). in natal female chil-\n","dren whose gender dysphoria does no t persist, the percentage who are gynephilic  (sexually\n","attracted to females) and sel f-identify as lesbian is lower (ranging from % to %).\n","in both adolescent and adult natal males, there are t wo broad trajectories for develop-\n","ment of gender dysphoria: early onset and late onset. early-onset gender dysphoria  starts in\n","childhood and continues into adolescence and adulthood; or, there is an intermittent pe-\n","riod in which the gender dysphoria desists and these individuals self-i dentify as gay or ho-\n","mosexual, followed by recurren ce of gender dysphoria. late-onset gender dysphoria  occurs\n","around puberty or much later in life. some of these individuals report having had a desire\n","to be of the other gender in childhood that was not expressed verbally to others. others do\n","not recall any signs of childhood gender dysp horia. for adolescent males with late-onset\n","gender dysphoria, parents often report surpri se because they did not see signs of gender gender dysphoria\n","dysphoria during childhood. expressions of anatomic dysphoria are more common and\n","salient in adolescents and adults once seco ndary sex characterist ics have developed. \n","adolescent and adult natal males with earl y-onset gender dysphoria are almost al-\n","ways sexually attracted to men (androphilic). adolescents and adults with late-onset gen-\n","der dysphoria frequently engage in transves tic behavior with sexual excitement. the\n","majority of these individuals are gynephilic or  sexually attracted to other posttransition\n","natal males with late-onset ge nder dysphoria. a substantia l percentage of adult males\n","with late-onset gender dyspho ria cohabit with or are marrie d to natal females. after gen-\n","der transition, many self-identify as lesbian. among adult natal males with gender dyspho-\n","ria, the early-onset group seeks out clinical  care for hormone treatment and reassignment\n","surgery at an earlier age than does the late-onset group. the late-onset group may have more\n","fluctuations in the degree of gender dyspho ria and be more ambivalent about and less\n","likely satisfied after gender  reassignment surgery. \n","in both adolescent and adult natal females, the most common  course is the early-onset\n","form of gender dysphoria. the late-onset fo rm is much less common in natal females com-\n","pared with natal males. as in natal males with gender dysphoria, there may have been a\n","period in which the gender dysphoria desisted and these individuals self-identified as les-\n","bian; however, with recurrence of gender dysphoria, clinical consultation is sought, often\n","with the desire for hormone treatment and reas signment surgery. parents of natal adoles-\n","cent females with the late-onset form also report surprise, as no signs of childhood gender\n","dysphoria were evident. expressions of anat omic dysphoria are mu ch more common and\n","salient in adolescents and adults than in children.\n","adolescent and adult natal females with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost\n","always gynephilic. adolescents and adults with  the late-onset form of gender dysphoria\n","are usually androphilic and after gender transit ion self-identify as gay men. natal females\n","with the late-onset form do not have co-occu rring transvestic behavi or with sexual ex-\n","citement. \n","gender dysphoria in association with a disorder of sex development. most individuals\n","with a disorder of sex development who develop gender dysphoria have already come to\n","medical attention at an early age. for many, st arting at birth, issues of gender assignment\n","were raised by physicians and parents. more over, as infertility is quite common for this\n","group, physicians are more willing to perfor m cross-sex hormone treatments and genital\n","surgery before adulthood.\n","disorders of sex development in general are frequently as sociated with gender-atypi-\n","cal behavior starting in early childhood. howeve r, in the majority of cases, this does not\n","lead to gender dysphoria. as individuals with a disorder of sex development become\n","aware of their medical history and condition, many experience uncertainty about their\n","gender, as opposed to developing a firm co nviction that they are another gender. how-\n","ever, most do not progress to gender transit ion. gender dysphoria and gender transition\n","may vary considerably as a function of a disord er of sex development, its severity, and as-\n","signed gender. \n","risk and prognostic factors\n","temperamental. for individuals with gender dyspho ria without a disorder of sex de-\n","velopment, atypical gender behavior among individuals with early-onset gender dyspho-\n","ria develops in early preschool age, and it is possible that a high degree of atypicality\n","makes the development of gender dysphoria and its persistence into adolescence and\n","adulthood more likely.\n","environmental. among individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex de-\n","velopment, males with gender dysphoria (in both childhood and adolescence) more com-\n","monly have older brothers than do males without the condition. additional predisposinggender dysphoria \n","factors under consideration, especially in indi viduals with late-onset gender dysphoria (ad-\n","olescence, adulthood), include habitual fetishistic transvesti sm developing into autogyne-\n","philia (i.e., sexual arousal asso ciated with the thought or imag e of oneself as  a woman) and\n","other forms of more general social, psychological, or developmental problems.\n","genetic and physiological. for individuals with gender dy sphoria without a disorder of\n","sex development, some genetic contribution is suggested by evidence for (weak) familial-\n","ity of transsexualism among nontwin siblings, increased concordance for transsexualism\n","in monozygotic compared with dizygotic same -sex twins, and some degree of heritability\n","of gender dysphoria. as to endocrine findin gs, no endogenous systemic abnormalities in\n","sex-hormone levels have been found in ,xy individuals, whereas there appear to be in-\n","creased androgen levels (in the range found in hirsute women but far below normal male\n","levels) in ,xx individuals. overall, current evidence is insufficient to label gender dys-\n","phoria without a disorder of sex development as  a form of intersexuality limited to the cen-\n","tral nervous system.\n","in gender dysphoria associated with a disorder of sex development, the likelihood of\n","later gender dysphoria is increased if pren atal production and utilization (via receptor\n","sensitivity) of androgens are grossly atypical re lative to what is usually seen in individuals\n","with the same assigned gender. examples incl ude ,xy individuals with a history of nor-\n","mal male prenatal hormone milieu but inborn nonhormonal genital defects (as in cloacal\n","bladder exstrophy or penile agenesis) and who have been assigned to the female gender.\n","the likelihood of gender dysphoria is furthe r enhanced by additional, prolonged, highly\n","gender-atypical postnatal androgen exposure with somatic virilization as may occur in fe-\n","male-raised and noncastrated ,xy individu als with -alpha reductase- deficiency or\n","-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrog enase- deficiency or in female-raised ,xx individuals\n","with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasi a with prolonged periods of non-adherence to\n","glucocorticoid replacement therapy. howeve r, the prenatal androgen milieu is more\n","closely related to gendered behavior than to gender identity. many individuals with dis-\n","orders of sex development and markedly gend er-atypical behavior do not develop gender\n","dysphoria. thus, gender-atypical behavior by itself should not be interpreted as an indi-\n","cator of current or future gend er dysphoria. there appears to be a higher rate of gender\n","dysphoria and patient-initiated gender change from assigned female to male than from as-\n","signed male to female in ,xy individu als with a disorder of sex development.\n","culture-related diagnostic issues\n","individuals with gender dysphoria have be en reported across many countries and cul-\n","tures. the equivalent of gender dysphoria ha s also been reported in individuals living in\n","cultures with institutionalized gender categories other than ma le or female. it is unclear\n","whether with these individuals the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria would be met.\n","diagnostic markers \n","individuals with a somatic disorder of sex development show some correlation of final\n","gender identity outcome with the degree of prenatal androgen production and utilization.\n","however, the correlation is not robust enough for the biological factor, where ascertain-\n","able, to replace a detailed an d comprehensive diagnostic in terview evaluation for gender\n","dysphoria. \n","functional consequences  of gender dysphoria\n","preoccupation with cross-gender wishes may de velop at all ages after the first – years of\n","childhood and often interfere with daily activities. in older children, failure to develop\n","age-typical same-sex peer relationships and skills may lead to isolation from peer groups\n","and to distress. some children may refuse to attend school because of teasing and harass- gender dysphoria\n","ment or pressure to dress in attire associated  with their assigned sex. also in adolescents\n","and adults, preoccupation with cross-gender w ishes often interferes with daily activities.\n","relationship difficulties, including sexual relationship problems, are common, and func-\n","tioning at school or at work may be impa ired. gender dysphoria, along with atypical\n","gender expression, is associated with high le vels of stigmatization , discrimination, and\n","victimization, leading to nega tive self-concept, increased ra tes of mental disorder comor-\n","bidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including unemployment, with at-\n","tendant social and mental health risks, especially in individuals from resource-poor family\n","backgrounds. in addition, these individuals’ access to health services and mental health\n","services may be impeded by structural barriers,  such as institutional discomfort or inex-\n","perience in working with this patient population.\n","differential diagnosis\n","nonconformity to gender roles. gender dysphoria should be distinguished from sim-\n","ple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of an-\n","other gender than the assigned one and by th e extent and pervasivene ss of gender-variant\n","activities and interests. the diagnosis is not meant to mere ly describe nonconformity to\n","stereotypical gender role behavior (e.g., “t omboyism” in girls, “girly-boy” behavior in\n","boys, occasional cross-dressing in adult men). given the increased openness of atypical\n","gender expressions by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it\n","is important that the clinical diagnosis be lim ited to those individuals whose distress and\n","impairment meet the specified criteria.\n","transvestic disorder. transvestic disorder occurs in he terosexual (or bisexual) adoles-\n","cent and adult males (rarely in females) fo r whom cross-dressing behavior generates sex-\n","ual excitement and causes distress and/or  impairment without drawing their primary\n","gender into question. it is occasionally ac companied by gender dysphoria. an individual\n","with transvestic disorder who also has clinica lly significant gender dysphoria can be given\n","both diagnoses. in many cases of late-onset  gender dysphoria in gynephilic natal males,\n","transvestic behavior with sexu al excitement is a precursor.\n","body dysmorphic disorder. an individual with body dy smorphic disorder focuses on\n","the alteration or removal of a sp ecific body part because it is perceived as abnormally formed,\n","not because it represents a repudiated assign ed gender. when an individual’s presenta-\n","tion meets criteria for both gender dysphori a and body dysmorphic disorder, both diag-\n","noses can be given. individuals wishing to  have a healthy limb amputated (termed by\n","some body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more “complete” usually\n","do not wish to change gender, but rather desi re to live as an amput ee or a disabled person.\n","schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. in schizophrenia, there may rarely be\n","delusions of belonging to some  other gender. in the absence of psychotic symptoms, in-\n","sistence by an individual with gender dysphori a that he or she is of some other gender is\n","not considered a delusion. schizophrenia (or other psychotic disorders) and gender dys-\n","phoria may co-occur.\n","other clinical presentations. some individuals with an emasculinization desire who\n","develop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale ge nder identity do have  a presentation that\n","meets criteria for gender dys phoria. however, some males seek castration and/or penec-\n","tomy for aesthetic reasons or to remove psychological effects of androgens without chang-\n","ing male identity; in these cases, the cr iteria for gender dysphoria are not met. \n","comorbidity \n","clinically referred children with gender dysphoria show elevated le vels of emotional and\n","behavioral problems—most commonly, anxiety, disruptive and impulse-control, and de-other specified gender dysphoria \n","pressive disorders. in prepub ertal children, increasing age is associated with having more\n","behavioral or emotional problems; this is rela ted to the increasing non-acceptance of gen-\n","der-variant behavior by others. in older chil dren, gender-variant behavior often leads to\n","peer ostracism, which may lead to more be havioral problems. the prevalence of mental\n","health problems differs among cultures; these differences may also be  related to differences\n","in attitudes toward gender variance in child ren. however, also in  some non-western cul-\n","tures, anxiety has been found to be relatively  common in individuals with gender dysphoria,\n","even in cultures with accepting attitudes to ward gender-variant be havior. autism spec-\n","trum disorder is more

chapters.\n","diagnostic features\n","the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is based on the assessment of an uninterrupted\n","period of illness during which the individual co ntinues to display active or residual symp-\n","toms of psychotic illness. the diagnosis is usually, but not necessarily, made during the\n","period of psychotic illness. at some time during the period, criterion a for schizophreniaschizoaffective disorder \n","has to be met. criteria b (soc ial dysfunction) and f (exclusion  of autism sp ectrum disorder\n","or other communication disorder of childhood onset) for schizophrenia do not have to be\n","met. in addition to meeting criterion a for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode\n","(major depressive or manic) (criterion a for schizoaffective disorder). because loss of in-\n","terest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia,  to meet criterion a for schizoaffective dis-\n","order, the major depressive episode must in clude pervasive depressed mood (i.e., the\n","presence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficie nt). episodes of de-\n","pression or mania are present for the majority of  the total duration of the illness (i.e., after\n","criterion a has been met) (criterion c for schi zoaffective disorder). to separate schizoaf-\n","fective disorder from a depressive or bipola r disorder with psychotic features, delusions\n","or hallucinations must be present for at least   weeks in the absence of a major mood epi-\n","sode (depressive or manic) at some point duri ng the lifetime duration  of the illness (cri-\n","terion b for schizoaffective disorder). the symptoms must not be attributable to the effects\n","of a substance or another medical condition (criterion d for schi zoaffective disorder).\n","criterion c for schizoaf fective disorder specifies that mood symptoms meeting criteria\n","for a major mood episode must be present for the majority of the total duration of the ac-\n","tive and residual portion of the illness. criter ion c requires the asses sment of mood symp-\n","toms for the entire course of a psychotic illnes s, which differs from th e criterion in dsm-iv,\n","which required only an assessment of the curr ent period of illness. if the mood symptoms\n","are present for only a relative ly brief period, the diagnosis is schizophrenia, not schizoaf-\n","fective disorder. when deciding whether an individual’s presentation meets criterion c,\n","the clinician should review the total duration of psychotic illness (i.e., both active and re-\n","sidual symptoms) and determine when significa nt mood symptoms (untreated or in need\n","of treatment with antidepressant and/or mo od-stabilizing medication) accompanied the\n","psychotic symptoms. this determination requir es sufficient histor ical information and\n","clinical judgment. for example, an individual with a -year history of active and residual\n","symptoms of schizophrenia develops depressi ve and manic episodes that, taken together,\n","do not occupy more than  year during the - year history of psycho tic illness. this presen-\n","tation would not meet criterion c.\n","in addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the\n","assessment of cognition, depression, and mani a symptom domains is vital for making crit-\n","ically important distinctions between the va rious schizophrenia spectrum and other psy-\n","chotic disorders.\n","associated features supporting diagnosis\n","occupational functioning is frequently impair ed, but this is not a defining criterion (in\n","contrast to schizophrenia). restricted social contact and difficulties with self-care are as-\n","sociated with schizoaffective disorder, but negative symptoms  may be less severe and less\n","persistent than those seen in schizophrenia. anosognosia (i.e., poor insight) is also com-\n","mon in schizoaffective disorder, but the deficits in insight may be less severe and perva-\n","sive than those in schizophrenia. individual s with schizoaffective disorder may be at\n","increased risk for later developing episodes of  major depressive disorder or bipolar disor-\n","der if mood symptoms contin ue following the remission of symptoms meeting criterion a\n","for schizophrenia. there may be associated al cohol and other substance-related disorders. \n","there are no tests or biological measures that can assist in making the diagnosis of\n","schizoaffective disorder. whether schizoaffe ctive disorder differs from schizophrenia\n","with regard to associated features such as structural or function al brain abnormalities,\n","cognitive deficits, or geneti c risk factors is not clear.\n","prevalence\n","schizoaffective disorder appe ars to be about one-third as common as schizophrenia. life-\n","time prevalence of schizoaffective disorder  is estimated to be .%. the incidence of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders\n","schizoaffective disorder is higher  in females than in males, mainly due to an increased in-\n","cidence of the depressive type among females.\n","development and course\n","the typical age at onset of schizoaffective di sorder is early adulthood, although onset can\n","occur anywhere from adolescence to late in lif e. a significant number of individuals diag-\n","nosed with another psychotic illness initially will receive the diagnosis schizoaffective dis-\n","order later when the pattern of mood epis odes has become more apparent. with the\n","current diagnostic criterion c, it is expected  that the diagnosis for some individuals will\n","convert from schizoaffective d isorder to another disorder as mood symptoms become less\n","prominent. the prognosis for schizoaffective di sorder is somewhat better than the prog-\n","nosis for schizophrenia but worse than the prognosis for mood disorders. \n","schizoaffective disorder may occur in a variety of temporal patterns. the following is\n","a typical pattern: an individual may have pronounced auditory hallucinations and per-\n","secutory delusions for  months  before the onset of a prom inent major depressive episode.\n","the psychotic symptoms and the full major depr essive episode are then present for  months.\n","then, the individual recovers completely fr om the major depressive episode, but the psy-\n","chotic symptoms persist for another month be fore they too disappear. during this period\n","of illness, the individual’s symptoms concurre ntly met criteria for a major depressive ep-\n","isode and criterion a for schizophrenia, and during this same period of illness, auditory\n","hallucinations and delusions were present both before and after the depressive phase. the\n","total period of illness lasted for about  mo nths, with psychotic sy mptoms alone present\n","during the initial  months, both depressive  and psychotic symptoms present during the\n","next  months, and psychotic symptoms alone pr esent during the last month. in this in-\n","stance, the duration of the depressive episode was not brief relative to the total duration of\n","the psychotic disturbance, and thus the presen tation qualifies for a diagnosis of schizoaf-\n","fective disorder.\n","the expression of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan is variable. depressive or\n","manic symptoms can occur before the onset of psychosis, during acute psychotic episodes,\n","during residual periods, and after cessation of psychosis. for example, an individual\n","might present with prominent mood symptoms  during the prodromal stage of schizo-\n","phrenia. this pattern is not necessarily indicative  of schizoaffective disorder, since it is the\n","co-occurrence of psychotic and mood symptoms  that is diagnostic. for an individual with\n","symptoms that clearly meet the criteria for sc hizoaffective disorder but who on further fol-\n","low-up only presents with residual psychoti c symptoms (such as subthreshold psychosis\n","and/or prominent negative symptoms), the diagnosis may be changed to schizophrenia,\n","as the total proportion of psychotic illness compared with mood symptoms becomes more\n","prominent. schizoaffective diso rder, bipolar type, may be more common in young adults,\n","whereas schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, may be more common in older adults. \n","risk and prognostic factors\n","genetic and physiological. among individuals with schizophrenia, there may be an in-\n","creased risk for schizoaffective disorder in first-degree relatives. the risk for schizoaffec-\n","tive disorder may be increased among indivi duals who have a first- degree relative with\n","schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. \n","culture-related diagnostic issues \n","cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly  when the individual\n","and the clinician do not share the same cultur al and economic backgr ound. ideas that ap-\n","pear to be delusional in one culture (e.g., witchcraft) may be commonly held in another.\n","there is also some evidence in the literature for the overdiagnosis of schizophrenia com-schizoaffective disorder \n","pared with schizoaffective disorder in afri can american and hispanic populations, so\n","care must be taken to ensure a culturally appropri ate evaluation that includes both psy-\n","chotic and affective symptoms.\n","suicide risk \n","the lifetime risk of suicide for schizophreni a and schizoaffective disorder is %, and the\n","presence of depressive symptoms is correlated with a higher risk for suicide. there is ev-\n","idence that suicide rates are higher in north american populations than in european,\n","eastern european, south american, and indian  populations of individuals with schizo-\n","phrenia or schizoaffective disorder.\n","functional consequences of  schizoaffective disorder\n","schizoaffective disorder is associated with social and occupational dysfunction, but dys-\n","function is not a diagnostic criterion (as it is for schizophrenia), an d there is substantial\n","variability between individuals diagno sed with schizoaffective disorder.\n","differential diagnosis\n","other mental disorders and medical conditions. a wide variety of psychiatric and med-\n","ical conditions can manifest with psychotic and mood symptoms that must be considered\n","in the differential diagnosis of  schizoaffective disorder. th ese include psychotic disorder\n","due to another medical condition; delirium; major neurocognitive disorder; substance/\n","medication-induced psychotic disorder or neurocognitive disorder; bipolar disorders\n","with psychotic features; major depressive diso rder with psychotic features; depressive or\n","bipolar disorders with catatonic features; schi zotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality\n","disorder; brief psychotic disorder; schizophre niform disorder; schizophrenia; delusional\n","disorder; and other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic\n","disorders. medical conditions and substance use can present with a combination of psy-\n","chotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychoti c disorder due to another medical condition\n","needs to be excluded. distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and\n","from depressive and bipolar diso rders with psychotic features  is often difficult. criterion\n","c is designed to separate schizoaffective di sorder from schizophrenia, and criterion b is\n","designed to distinguish schizoaffective diso rder from a depressive or bipolar disorder\n","with psychotic features. more specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished\n","from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psyc hotic features due to the presence of prom-\n","inent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least  weeks in the absence of a major mood\n","episode. in contrast, in depressive or bipo lar disorders with psychotic features, the psy-\n","chotic features primarily occur during the mo od episode(s). because the relative propor-\n","tion of mood to psychotic symptoms may ch ange over time, the appropriate diagnosis\n","may change from and to schizoaffective disord er (e.g., a diagnosis of schizoaffective dis-\n","order for a severe and prominent major depre ssive episode lasting  months during the\n","first  months of a persistent psychotic illnes s would be changed to schizophrenia if active\n","psychotic or prominent residual symptoms pe rsist over several years without a recurrence\n","of another mood episode).\n","psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. other medical conditions and\n","substance use can manifest with a combinat ion of psychotic and mood symptoms, and\n","thus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition needs to be excluded. \n","schizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorders. distinguishing schizoaffective dis-\n","order from schizophrenia and from depressiv e and bipolar disorders with psychotic fea-\n","tures is often difficult. criterion c is design ed to separate schizoaffective disorder from\n","schizophrenia, and criterion b is  designed to distinguish schi zoaffective disorder from a schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders\n","depressive or bipolar disorder with psychoti c features. more specifically, schizoaffective\n","disorder can be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features\n","based on the presence of prom inent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least  weeks in\n","the absence of a major mood episode. in cont rast, in depressive or bipolar disorder with\n","psychotic features, the psychoti c features primarily occur duri ng the mood episode(s). be-\n","cause the relative proportion of mood to ps ychotic symptoms may change over time, the\n","appropriate diagnosis may change from and to  schizoaffective disorder. (for example, a\n","diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder for a se vere and prominent major depressive episode\n","lasting  months during the first  months of  a chronic psychotic illness would be changed\n","to schizophrenia if active ps ychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several\n","years without a recurrence of another mood episode.) \n","comorbidity\n","many individuals diagnosed with schizoaffect ive disorder are also diagnosed with other\n","mental disorders, especially substance use d isorders and anxiety disorders. similarly, the\n","incidence of medical conditions is increase d above base rate for the general population\n","and leads to decre ased life expectancy.\n","substance/medication-induced\n"," psychotic disorder\n","diagnostic criteria  \n","a. presence of one or both of the following symptoms:\n",". delusions.\n",". hallucinations.\n","b. there is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both\n","() and ():\n",". the symptoms in criterion a developed during or soon after substance intoxication\n","or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.\n",". the involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in crite-\n","rion a.\n","c. the disturbance is not better explained by a psychotic disorder that is not substance/\n","medication-induced. such evidence of an independent psychotic disorder could in-\n","clude the following: \n","the symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms\n","persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about  month) after the cessation of\n","acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence of an indepen-\n","dent non-substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder (e.g., a history of recur-\n","rent non-substance/medication-related episodes).\n","d. the disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium.\n","e. the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupa-\n","tional, or other important areas of functioning.\n","note: this diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or\n","substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in criterion a predominate in the clinical\n","picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.\n","Schizoaffective Disorder.pdf\n"," sleep-wake disorders\n","most relevant to the mental he alth provider, with medication use (e.g., benzodiazepines, opi-\n","ates). congenital central alveol ar hypoventilation often occurs in association with autonomic\n","dysfunction and may occur in association with hirschsprung’s disease. copd, a disorder of\n","lower airway obstruction usually associated with cigarette sm oking, can result in sleep-\n","related hypoventilation and hypoxemia. the pres ence of coexisting obstructive sleep apnea\n","hypopnea is thought to exacerbate hypoxemia and hypercapnia during sleep and wakeful-\n","ness. the relationship between congenital central alveolar hypoventilation and idiopathic\n","sleep-related hypoventilation is unclear; in some individuals, idiopathic sleep-related hy-\n","poventilation may represent cases of late-onset  congenital central alveolar hypoventilation.\n","relationship to internat ional classification of \n","sleep disorders\n","the international classificat ion of sleep disorders,  nd edition (icsd-), combines sleep-\n","related hypoventilation and sleep-related hypo xemia under the category of sleep-related\n","hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. this ap proach to classificati on reflects the fre-\n","quent co-occurrence of disorder s that lead to hypoventilation  and hypoxemia. in contrast,\n","the classification used in ds m- reflects evidence that th ere are distinct sleep-related\n","pathogenetic processes le ading to hypoventilation.\n","circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders\n","diagnostic criteria\n","a. a persistent or recurrent pattern of sleep disruption that is primarily due to an alteration\n","of the circadian system or to a misalignment between the endogenous circadian\n","rhythm and the sleep–wake schedule required by an individual’s physical environment\n","or social or professional schedule. \n","b. the sleep disruption leads to excessive sleepiness or insomnia, or both.\n","c. the sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc-\n","cupational, and other important areas of functioning.\n","coding note:  for icd--cm, code . for all subtypes. for icd--cm, code is based\n","on subtype.\n","specify whether:\n",".

is social isolation and/or lack of\n","light and structured activities. \n","non--hour sleep-wake type\n","diagnostic features\n","the diagnosis of non--hour sleep-wake type  is based primarily on a history of symp-\n","toms of insomnia or excessive sleepiness related to abnormal synchronization between the\n","-hour light-dark cycle and the endogenous circadian rhythm. individuals typically pre-\n","sent with periods of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or both, which alternate with short\n","asymptomatic periods. starting with the asymptomatic period, when the individual’s\n","sleep phase is aligned to the external envi ronment, sleep latency will gradually increase\n","and the individual will complain of sleep-onset insomnia. as the sleep phase continues to\n","drift so that sleep time is no w in the daytime, the individu al will have trouble staying\n","awake during the day and will complain of sleepiness. because the circadian period is not\n","aligned to the external -hour environment,  symptoms will depend on when an individ-\n","ual tries to sleep in relation to the circadian rhythm of sleep propensity. \n","associated features supporting diagnosis\n","non--hour sleep-wake type is most common among blind or visually impaired individ-\n","uals who have decreased light perception. in si ghted individuals, there is often a history of\n","delayed sleep phase and

\n","prevalence\n","the prevalence of shift work ty pe is unclear, but the disorder is estimated to affect %–%\n","of the night worker population  (%–% of the workforce). prevalence rises with

persistent difficulties discarding or parting\n","with possessions, regardless of their actual value (criterion a). the term persistent  indi-\n","cates a long-standing difficulty rather than more transient life circumstances that may lead\n","to excessive clutter, such as inheriting prop erty. the difficulty in discarding possessions\n","noted in criterion a refers to  any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling,\n","giving away, or recycling. the main reasons given for these difficult ies are the perceived\n","utility or aesthetic value of the items or stro ng sentimental attachment to the possessions.\n","some individuals feel responsi ble for the fate of their possessions and often go to great\n","lengths to avoid being wasteful. fears of lo sing important information are also common.\n","the most commonly saved item s are newspapers, magazines, old clothing, bags, books,\n","mail, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved. the nature of items is not lim-\n","ited to possessions that most other people would define as useles s or of limited value.\n","many individuals collect and save large numbers of valuable things as well, which are of-\n","ten found in piles mixed with other less valuable items. \n","individuals with hoarding disorder purpos efully save possessions and experience dis-\n","tress when facing the prospect of discarding them (criterion b). this criterion emphasizes\n","that the saving of possessions is intentional,  which discriminates hoarding disorder from\n","other forms of psychopathology that are ch aracterized by the pa ssive accumulation of\n","items or the absence of distress  when possessions are removed. \n","individuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter active living ar-\n","eas to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible (criterion c). for example,\n","the individual may not be able to cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a\n","chair. if the space can be used, it  is only with great difficulty. clutter  is defined as a large\n","group of usually unrelated or marginally rela ted objects piled together in a disorganized\n","fashion in spaces designed for ot her purposes (e.g., tabletops,  floor, hallway). criterion c\n","emphasizes the “active” living areas of the ho me, rather than more peripheral areas, such\n","as garages, attics, or basements, that are so metimes cluttered in homes of individuals with-\n","out hoarding disorder. however, individuals with hoarding disorder often have posses-\n","sions that spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other\n","spaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace,  and friends’ and relatives’ houses. in some\n","cases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the intervention of third parties (e.g.,\n","family members, cleaners, loca l authorities). individuals who have been forced to clear\n","their homes still have a symptom picture that meets criteria fo r hoarding disorder because\n","the lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention. hoarding disorder contrasts with\n","normative collecting beha vior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases\n","the actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an indi-\n","vidual with hoarding disord er. normative collecting does not produce the clutter, dis-\n","tress, or impairment typi cal of hoarding disorder. \n","symptoms (i.e., difficulties discarding and/or  clutter) must cause clinically significant\n","distress or impairment in social, occupational , or other important area s of functioning, in-\n","cluding maintaining a safe environment for self  and others (criterion d). in some cases,hoarding disorder \n","particularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the im-\n","pairment may be apparent only to those arou nd the individual. however, any attempts to\n","discard or clear the possessions by third pa rties result in high levels of distress. \n","associated features supporting diagnosis\n","other common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism,\n","avoidance, procrastination, di fficulty planning and organizing tasks, and distractibility.\n","some individuals with hoarding disorder live in unsanitary conditions that may be a log-\n","ical consequence of severely cluttered spaces and/or that are related to planning and or-\n","ganizing difficulties. animal hoarding  can be defined as the accumulation of a large number\n","of animals and a failure to provide minimal st andards of nutrition, sanitation, and veter-\n","inary care and to act on the de teriorating condition of the an imals (including disease, star-\n","vation, or death) and the en vironment (e.g., severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary\n","conditions). animal hoarding may be a spec ial manifestation of ho arding disorder. most\n","individuals who hoard animals also hoard inan imate objects. the mo st prominent differ-\n","ences between animal and object hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the\n","poorer insight in animal hoarding. \n","prevalence\n","nationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding disorder are not available. com-\n","munity surveys estimate the point prevalence of clinically significant hoarding in the\n","united states and europe to be approximately %–%. hoarding disorder affects both\n","males and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greater\n","prevalence among males. this contrasts with clinical samples, which are predominantly\n","female. hoarding symptoms appear to be almost three times more prevalent in older\n","adults (ages – years) compared with younger adults (ages – years). \n","development and course\n","hoarding appears to begin early in life and spans well into the late stages. hoarding symp-\n","toms may first emerge around ages – years, start interfering with the individual’s ev-\n","eryday functioning by the mid-s, and cause clinically significant impairment by the\n","mid-s. participants in clinical research stud ies are usually in their s. thus, the severity\n","of hoarding increases with each decade of lif e. once symptoms begin, the course of hoard-\n","ing is often chronic, with few individuals reporting a waxing and waning course.\n","pathological hoarding in children appears to be easily distin guished from develop-\n","mentally adaptive saving and collecting behaviors. because children and adolescents\n","typically do not control their living environm ent and discarding behaviors, the possible\n","intervention of third parties (e.g., parents ke eping the spaces usable and thus reducing in-\n","terference) should be considered when making the diagnosis. \n","risk and prognostic factors \n","temperamental. indecisiveness is a prominent featur e of individuals wi th hoarding dis-\n","order and their first-degree relatives.\n","environmental. individuals with hoarding disorder often retrospectively report stressful\n","and traumatic life events preceding the onset of the disorder or causing an exacerbation. \n","genetic and physiological. hoarding behavior is familial,  with about % of individu-\n","als who hoard reporting having a relative who also hoards. twin studies indicate that ap-\n","proximately % of the variability in hoarding behavior is attr ibutable to additive genetic\n","factors.  obsessive-compulsive and related disorders\n","culture-related diagnostic issues\n","while most of the research has been done in  western, industrialized countries and urban\n","communities, the available data from non-western and developing countries suggest that\n","hoarding is a universal phenomenon wi th consistent clinical features. \n","gender-related diagnostic issues\n","the key features of hoarding disorder (i.e., difficulties discarding, excessive amount of\n","clutter) are generally comparable in males an d females, but females tend to display more\n","excessive acquisition, particularly excessive buying, than do males. \n","functional consequences  of hoarding disorder\n","clutter impairs basic activities, such as moving through the house, cooking, cleaning, per-\n","sonal hygiene, and even sleepin g. appliances may be broken, and utilities such as water\n","and electricity may be disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. quality of\n","life is often considerably impaired. in severe cases, hoarding can put in dividuals at risk for\n","fire, falling (especially elderly individuals), po or sanitation, and other health risks. hoard-\n","ing disorder is associated with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high\n","social service utilization. family relationsh ips are frequently under great strain. conflict\n","with neighbors and local author ities is common, and a substa ntial proportion of individ-\n","uals with severe hoarding disorder have been  involved in legal eviction proceedings, and\n","some have a history of eviction. \n","differential diagnosis\n","other medical conditions. hoarding disorder is not di agnosed if the symptoms are\n","judged to be a direct conseque nce of another medical condition (criterion e), such as trau-\n","matic brain injury, surgical resection for trea tment of a tumor or seizure control, cerebro-\n","vascular disease, infections of the central ne rvous system (e.g., herpes simplex encephalitis),\n","or neurogenetic conditions such as prader -willi syndrome. damage to the anterior ven-\n","tromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices ha s been particularly associated with the ex-\n","cessive accumulation of objects. in these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present\n","prior to the onset of the brain damage and a ppears shortly after the brain damage occurs.\n","some of these individuals appear to have li ttle interest in the accumulated items and are\n","able to discard them easily or do not care if  others discard them, whereas others appear to\n","be very reluctant to discard anything. \n","neurodevelopmental disorders. hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumula-\n","tion of objects is judged to be a direct co nsequence of a neurodevel opmental disorder, such\n","as autism spectrum disorder or  intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder).\n","schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. hoarding disorder is not di-\n","agnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged  to be a direct consequence of delusions or\n","negative symptoms in schizophrenia sp ectrum and other psychotic disorders.\n","major depressive episode. hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\n","objects is judged to be a dire ct consequence of ps ychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of\n","energy during a major depressive episode. \n","obsessive-compulsive disorder. hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms\n","are judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears\n","of contamination, harm, or feelings of inco mpleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder\n","(ocd). feelings of incomplete ness (e.g., losing one’s identity , or having to document and\n","preserve all life experiences) are the most frequent ocd symptoms associated with this\n","form of hoarding. the accumulation of objects can also be the result of persistently avoid-trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) \n","ing onerous rituals (e.g., not discarding object s in order to avoid endless washing or check-\n","ing rituals).\n","in ocd, the behavior is gene rally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual ex-\n","periences no pleasure or reward from it. excessive acquisition is  usually not present; if exces-\n","sive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e.g., the need to\n","buy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid cont aminating other people),\n","not because of a genuine desire to possess the items. individuals who hoard in the context of\n","ocd are also more likely to accumulate bizarre it ems, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair,\n","used diapers, or rotten food. accumulation of su ch items is very unusual in hoarding disorder.\n","when severe hoarding appears concurrently  with other typical symptoms of ocd but\n","is judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and ocd may\n","be diagnosed. \n","neurocognitive disorders. hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of\n","objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerati ve disorder, such as neurocog-\n","nitive disorder associated wi th frontotemporal lobar degeneration or alzheimer’s disease.\n","typically, onset of the accumu lating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neuro-\n","cognitive disorder. the accumulating behavior  may be accompanied by self-neglect and\n","severe domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibi-\n","tion, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors. \n","comorbidity\n","approximately % of individuals with hoardi ng disorder have a comorbid mood or anx-\n","iety disorder. the most common comorbid conditions are major depressive disorder (up\n","to

fran tic efforts to avoid real or\n","imagined abandonment (criterion ). the perception of impending separation or rejection,\n","or the loss of external structure, can lead to profound changes in sel

faced with a real-\n","istic time-limited separation or when there are unavoidable changes in plans (e.g., sudden\n","despair in reaction to a clinician’s announcing the end of the hour; panic or fury when some-\n","one important to them is just a few minutes la te or must cancel an appointment). they may\n","believe that this “abandonment” implies they  are “bad.” these abandonment fears are re-\n","lated to an intolerance of being alone and a need  to have other people with them. their frantic personality disorders\n","efforts to avoid abandonment may include impulsive actions such as self-mutilating or sui-\n","cidal behaviors, which are described separately in criterion .\n","individuals with borderline personality disord er have a pattern of unstable and intense\n","relationships (criterion ). they may idealize potential caregivers or lovers at the first or\n","second meeting, demand to spend a lot of time  together, and share the most intimate

enough,\n","or is not “there” enough. these individuals can empathize with and nurture other people,\n","but only with the expectation th at the other person will “be ther e” in return to meet their\n","own needs on demand. these indi viduals are prone to sudden and dramatic shifts in their\n","view of others, who may alternatively be seen as beneficent supports or as cruelly punitive.\n","such shifts often reflect disillusionment with a caregiver whose nurturing qualities had\n","been idealized or whose rejectio n or abandonment is expected.\n","there may be an identity

ge from the role of a needy supplicant for\n","help to that of a righteous av enger of past mistreat ment. although they usually have a self-\n","image that is based on being bad or evil, individuals with this disorder may at times have\n","feelings that they do not exist at all. such experiences usually occur in situations in which\n","the individual feels a lack of a meaningful relationship,

and\n","chronic feelings of deep emptiness and loneline ss. paranoid ideas or illusions may be pres-\n","ent in both borderline personality disorder an d schizotypal personality disorder, but these\n","symptoms are more transient, in terpersonally reactive, and responsive to external structur-\n","ing in borderline personality disorder. althou gh paranoid personalit y disorder and

in\n","several different areas of functioning (e.g., so cial, occupational, academic, and leisure), in\n","part because of avoidance of social situations. \n","associated features supporting diagnosis\n","skin picking may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals involving skin or scabs.\n","thus, individuals may search for a particular kind of scab to pull, and they may examine,\n","play with, or mouth or swallow th e skin after it has be en pulled. skin picking may also be pre-\n","ceded or accompanied by various emotional stat es. skin picking may be triggered by feelings\n","of anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an  increasing sense of tension (either immedi-\n","ately before picking the skin or when attempting to resist the urge to pick), and may lead to\n","gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the skin or scab has been picked. some indi-\n","viduals report picking in response to a minor skin irregularity or to relieve an uncomfortable\n","bodily sensation. pain is not routinely reported to accompany skin picking. some individuals\n","engage in skin picking that is more focused (i .e., with preceding tens ion and

associated  with distress as well as with social and occupational im-\n","pairment. the majority of indi viduals with this condition spend at least  hour per day\n","picking, thinking about picking, and resist ing urges to pick. many individuals report\n","avoiding social or entertainment events as well as going out in public. a majority of indi-\n","viduals with the disorder also report experien

frequently requires antibiotic treat-\n","ment for infection, and on o ccasion it may require surgery.\n","differential diagnosis\n","psychotic disorder. skin picking may occur in response to a delusion (i.e., parasitosis)\n","or tactile hallucination (i.e., fo rmication) in a psychotic disorder. in such cases, excoriation\n","disorder should not be diagnosed. \n","other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. excessive washing compulsions\n","in response to contamination obsessions in in dividuals with ocd may lead to skin lesions,\n","and skin picking may occur in individuals with

behavior disorder in other spec-\n","ified obsessive-compulsive and related diso rder excludes individuals whose symptoms\n","meet diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder.\n","neurodevelopmental disorders. while stereotypic movement disorder may be charac-\n","terized by repetitive self-injurious behavior , onset is in the early developmental period.\n","for example, individuals with  the neurogenetic condition prader-willi syndrome may\n","have early onset of skin picking, and their symptoms may meet criteria for stereotypic\n","movement disorder. while tics in individuals with

the\n","skin lesion is primarily attributable to de ceptive behaviors in factitious disorder.\n","other disorders. excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily\n","attributable to the intention to harm oneself th at is characteristic of nonsuicidal self-injury.\n","other medical conditions. excoriation disorder is not di agnosed if the skin picking is\n","primarily attributable to another medical condition. for example, scabies is a dermatolog-\n","ical condition invariably associated with seve re itching and scratching. however, excori-\n","ation disorder may be precipitated or ex acerbated by an unde rlying dermatological\n","condition. for example, acne may lead to so me scratching and picking, which may also be\n","associated with comorbid excoriation diso rder. the differentiation between these two\n","clinical situations (acne with some scratching  and picking vs. acne with comorbid excori-\n","ation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent to which the individual’s skin picking\n","has become independent of the unde rlying dermatological condition. \n","substance/medication-induced disorders. skin-picking symptoms may also be induced\n","by certain substances (e.g., cocaine), in whic h case excoriation disorder should not be di-\n","agnosed. if such skin picking is clinically significant, then a diagnosis of substance/med-\n","ication-induced obsessive-compulsive and re lated disorder should be considered. substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related
